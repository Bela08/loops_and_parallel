# Iterating over data in R

---

## Three main methods:

* `for` and `while` loops

* `*apply` function family

* `map` function in `tidyverse`

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# `for` loops

---

# Recipe to successful `for` loop writing

1. Write down the general objective for the loop including the data that will be used

**For example:** Find all the characters in the starwars data that are older than X, and add the word "old" to their name.

2. Write in words each of the steps you will be taking to accomplish your objective

3. Write the code that fulfills each step

4. Test the loop on the first iteration
---

# Some more advice

* If the loop is complicated then start with a simplified loop and build on top of it

* If you think you need to write a loop within the loop try and find a way to use `*apply` or write a function that will execute the inner loop. 

* Annotate the code as if your life depends on it.

# Let's practice!

I want you to think of an objective that can be used in a loop and then write the steps that you will take to get this objective

# Come present your loop!

# More practice!

Write the code that fulfills each step of your loop and test that it runs

"It is faster to make a four-inch mirror and then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror." 

---

## Steps: 

1. Start with a limited but working chuck of code.
2. Rewrite it as a function. (psst.. FUN snippet..).

```{r}
name <- function(variables) {
  
}
```

3. Test it. OPTIONAL: conditional stopping of functions.
4. Name it. 
5. Use it in your code or within a more complicated function.

# Important!!
## All objects created within a function stay in the function unless you export them using `return()`
---

### For example: a function that multiplise a given number by 2

Won't return the result
```{r}
m2<- function(x){
  a<- x*2
}
m2(2)
```

Will return a result
```{r}
m2<- function(x){
  a<- x*2
  return(a) #<<
}
m2(2)
```

---

# How much code do we want to encapsule in a funcion?

Suprisingly, not so much. Focus on your function doing just one thing.

Most of R's functions are less than 12 lines long!

---

# Naming functions

Function names should be kept short yet informative. Remember: functions are meant to help codes be reusable and readable.

What are good names for these two functions?


```r
f1 <- function(string, prefix) {
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
}
f2 <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
  x[-length(x)]
}
```

# Let's practic!

Write a function that computes the square of the number it is given.

For example, if you give the function 10 it returns 100

---

# `apply` family functions

A family of functions to manipulate data in a repetitive way. 
These functions allow crossing the data in a number of ways and avoid explicit use of loop constructs.

The most used `apply` functions are `apply()` (that we saw before) and `lapply` that work on lists

---

# `apply()`

# Anonymous functions

Sometimes, you won't save the function like seen below, but rather - use it directly in a code:
In R functions are objects in their own right. They aren’t automatically bound to a name. If you choose not to give the function a name, you get an **anonymous function**.

```{r}
matrix_of_numbers <- matrix(1:100,5,10)
apply(matrix_of_numbers,2,function(x) x^2)
```
---
class: exercise

# Practice time!

multiply all the numbers in each row by a different number in the following dataframe (use apply)

```{r}
df<- as.data.frame(matrix(1:100,5,10))
df
```
---

# Iterations

To further streamline your code, use iterations to repeat chuncks of code.
Most basic are `for` and `while` loops. However, there are more ways to iterate code.

Iterations have three main components: an output, a sequence to iterate over, and the body of code.

---
# Vector allocation will save you a lot of time!

```r
library(tictoc)
n_times <- 50000
tic()
a <- NULL
for(i in seq_len(n_times)){
    a <- c(a, i^2)
    a
}
toc()
tic()
a <- vector("double", n_times)
for(i in seq_len(n_times)){
    a[i] <- i^2
}
toc()
```
---

# Sequence

`for (i in (1:10))` is a sequence. So is `while TRUE`. 
`for (i in seq_along(vector))` is a better way of sequencing if you might get a vector of length 0 like so:


```{r}
y <- vector("double", 0)
seq_along(y)
```

```{r}
#> integer(0)
1:length(y)
```

---

# for i in unique(df$column)

That's a common phrase when working with data.  So common that there is a tidyverse package that does it for you.

![](purrr.png) 
We will discuss it shortly...

---

# R is a functional language 

That means you can wrap loops within a function and just call that function when neccessary.
Remember - limit your copy and paste as much as possible!

```{r}
data <- data.frame(a=rnorm(10),
               b=rnorm(10))
col_means <- function(dataframe){
  output <- vector("double",ncol(dataframe))
  for (i in seq_along(dataframe)){
    output[[i]] <- mean(dataframe[[i]])
  }
  return(output)
}
col_means(data)
```

# 99 bottles of beer on the wall


Create a function that returns the full song for any number of any vessel (bottles,cans, even boxes... ) of any drink (But no Jägermeister please):

>99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer. Take one down, pass it around - 98 bottles of beer on the wall
